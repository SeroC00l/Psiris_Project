Description

This project is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage todo lists. It was built using Django, a powerful and popular web framework for Python.

The main features of the application include:

User registration and login: Users can create an account and log in to the application to access their personal todo lists.
Todo list management: Once logged in, users can create new todo lists, add items to them, mark items as completed, and delete items from the list.
Todo list sharing: Users can share their todo lists with other users of the application, allowing them to collaborate on the same list.
User profile: Each user has a profile page where they can update their personal information and view their todo lists.
The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, with the following components:

Models: The application uses Django's built-in models to define the data schema for todo lists, list items, and user profiles. The models are defined in the models.py file.
Views: The application's views handle HTTP requests and generate responses, rendering templates that display the appropriate content. The views are defined in the views.py file.
Templates: The application's templates define the structure and appearance of the web pages that users interact with. The templates are written in HTML and use Django's template language to dynamically display data. The templates are located in the templates directory.
URLs: The application's URLs map HTTP requests to views. The URLs are defined in the urls.py file.
The project also includes a virtual environment for Python dependencies, which can be installed using the requirements.txt file.

Overall, this project provides a simple and practical example of how to build a web application with Django, including user authentication, data modeling, and view rendering.
